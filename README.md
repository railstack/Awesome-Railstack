In fact all the frameworks apply to the rule *Convention over Configuration* intentionally or spontaneously, and Ruby on Rails emphasizes it especially.

After Rails 5.1 implemented webpacker to manage frondend environment, it become more like a *tool suite* of managing web development in my view, though it's also (the best) one of elegant web frameworks in the world.

So I think Rails is more like an integrated web programming environment than just a simple framework at present, it supports the full stack more completely. Now and then there arouses some arguing on Rails' performence, comparing to other languages or frameworks, but it doesn't matter. Rails can do more things than before, at least it can help you managing your frontend programming, splitting a monolithic Rails application into frontend and backend easily.

## What's Awesome-Railstack?

Awesome-Railstack is a curated list of awesome Rails gems and tools that charactorizes Rails' more as a convention/configuration tool of an integrated web programming. Its best and biggest example is [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker).

## List

* [webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker) Use Webpack to manage app-like JavaScript modules in Rails.
* [Go on Rails](https://github.com/railstack/go-on-rails) Use Rails generator to develop or generate a Golang application.
